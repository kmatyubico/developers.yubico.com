== Using SSH User Certificates with PIV keys
This is a step-by-step on how to setup SSH user certificates using PIV
for hardware-backed keys. This guide is primarily for an OS X or
Linux system.

=== Prerequisites
* a YubiKey with the PIV application loaded
* the yubico-piv-tool software
* the ykcs11 PKCS#11 module
* OpenSSH

[NOTE]
This has been tested as working with OpenSSH version 7.2p2.
It has also been tested as *not working* with OpenSSH version 6.9p1.


=== Steps
1. Generate an "ssh user CA" key and trust it for this account on this
host

  $ ssh-keygen -N '' -C user-ca -f ~/.ssh/ca
  $ sed 's/^/cert-authority /' ~/.ssh/ca.pub > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

2. Generate or import a key in PIV slot 9c that requires touch.
a. Import key and certificate:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s 9c -a import-key -i key.pem --pin-policy=never --touch-policy=always
  $ yubico-piv-tool -s 9c -a import-certificate -i cert.pem

b. Generate a key and sign a certificate. (Note the second operation will require touch)

  $ yubico-piv-tool -a generate -s 9c -A RSA2048 --pin-policy=never --touch-policy=always -o public.pem
  $ yubico-piv-tool -a selfsign-certificate -s 9c -S "/CN=SSH key/" -i public.pem -o cert.pem
  $ yubico-piv-tool -a import-certificate -s 9c -i cert.pem

3. Double check that the key appears in slot 9c (optional)

  $ yubico-piv-tool -a status

4. Clear the SSH agent

  $ ssh-add -D
  $ ssh-add -e /PATH/TO/libykcs11.so

  * Make sure to use the correct path (e.g. `/usr/local/lib`) and extension (`.so` for Linux, `.dylib` for Mac OS X) for libykcs11.

  * Beware that `ssh-add -D` doesn't seem to clear PKCS#11 libraries, only keys
(https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2016-July/035154.html[link]).

5. Add PIV to the SSH agent (will prompt for PIV PIN)

  $ ssh-add -s /PATH/TO/libykcs11.so

6. Get the public key from PIV and sign it using the CA key. This produces `~/.ssh/id_rsa-cert.pub`

  $ ssh-add -L > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  $ ssh-keygen -s ~/.ssh/ca -I identity -n "${LOGNAME}" ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

7. Authenticate to the target system using the new key:

   $ ssh user@remote.example.com

If you have followed these steps to the letter, you will not be asked for the PIV PIN, but your YubiKey will start blinking, waiting for touch.
