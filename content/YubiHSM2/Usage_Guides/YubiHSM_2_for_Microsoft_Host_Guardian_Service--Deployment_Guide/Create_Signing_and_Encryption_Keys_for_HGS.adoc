== Create Signing and Encryption Keys for HGS

=== Generate Signing and Encryption Keys and Certificates

Generate the signing and encryption keys and certificates for HGS by using the PowerShell cmdlet `New-SelfSignedCertificate`. In this guide, self-signed certificates will be used for HGS.

The HGS signing and encryption certificates must adhere to the following specifications:

* Crypto provider: YubiHSM Key Storage Provider.
* Key algorithm: RSA
* Minimum key size: 2048 bits
* Signature algorithm: SHA256
* Key usage: Digital signature and data encipherment
* Enhanced key usage: Server authentication
* Subject name: Recommended: your company's name or web address

Do the following to create the self-signed HGS certificates:

==== Step 1: Create the Self-signed HGS Signing Certificate and Key

Start a command prompt with administrator rights and type the command `PowerShell`. In the PowerShell command prompt, run the following cmdlet:

....
$ PS New-SelfSignedCertificate -Provider "YubiHSM Key Storage Provider" -Subject "CN=HGS Signing Certificate" -KeyExportPolicy NonExportable -KeyUsage DigitalSignature,DataEncipherment -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1") -KeyAlgorithm RSA -KeyLength 2048 -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\LocalMachine\My" -Verbose
....


==== Step 2: Create the Self-signed HGS Encryption Certificate and Key

In the PowerShell command prompt, run the following cmdlet:

....
PS C:\users\your-username\ New-SelfSignedCertificate -Provider "YubiHSM Key Storage Provider" -Subject "CN=HGS Encryption Certificate" -KeyExportPolicy NonExportable -KeyUsage DigitalSignature,DataEncipherment -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1") -KeyAlgorithm RSA -KeyLength 2048
 "Cert:\LocalMachine\My" -Verbose
....

**Figure 3 – Example of PowerShell cmdlet to create self-signed certificates**

Make a note of the thumbprints of the self-signed certificates. In this example, the signing certificate thumbprint is `A576F936B6F044586123FDE8CB3C7BDDA1431DA8` and the encryption certificate thumbprint is `5701A22B99C029FCFB578B9191AEFA8AF7454188`.


==== Step 3: Verify Generation and Storage of HGS Key-pairs in YubiHSM 2

Verify that the HGS key-pairs have been properly generated and stored in YubiHSM 2 by starting a command prompt and using `YubiHSM-Shell` to list the objects, as shown in the figure below.

==== Step 4: Verify Storage of HGS Certificates in Microsoft Certificate Store

Verify that corresponding HGS certificates have been stored in Microsoft certificate store. Launch the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) by going to the command line and typing `MMC.exe`.

a) In MMC, select **File > Add/remove Snap-in**.

b) In the **Add or Remove Snap-ins** window, select the option **Certificates > Computer Account > Local Computer**.

c) In the **Certificates (Local Computer)** console, expand the folders Personal > Certificates, and verify that the self-signed HGS signing and encryption certificates appear.

=== Initialize HGS with Signing and Encryption Keys and Certificates

Once the HGS signing and encryption keys and certificates have been generated, use them to initialize HGS.

Create the self-signed HGS certificates by starting a command prompt with administrator rights and typing the command `PowerShell`. In the PowerShell command prompt, run the following cmdlet to initialize HGS with the signing and encryption certificates.

[NOTE]
======
The parameters `SigningCertificateThumbprint` and `EncryptionCertificateThumbprint` should be set to the output values from the PowerShell cmdlet `New-SelfSignedCertificate` as described in the previous section.
======

....
PS C:\users\your-username\ Initialize-HgsServer -HgsServiceName 'MyHgsService' -SigningCertificateThumbprint '<SigningCertificateThumbprint>' -EncryptionCertificateThumbprint '<EncryptionCertificateThumbprint>'
....
